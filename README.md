## 📊 What You'll Find

- Inspection of HTTP GET/POST requests  
- DNS lookup traces  
- TCP 3-way handshake and teardown  
- Detection of anomalies or suspicious traffic

## ✍️ Why I Did This

Understanding how network protocols behave at the packet level is essential for system administrators, cybersecurity professionals, and backend engineers.  
This repository is part of my personal learning journey in networking fundamentals.

## ✅ Future Additions

- Add `.pcap` files with malware/suspicious activity (obfuscated if needed)  
- Use filters in `tshark` for automated reporting  
- Compare protocols over Wi-Fi vs Ethernet

## 📸 Sample Screenshot

_Add here a screenshot of a Wireshark packet list view or follow-stream of HTTP request if you want_
